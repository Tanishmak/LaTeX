%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem} 
    Let $G$ be a finite Abelian group and let $n$ be a positive integer that is relatively prime to $|G|$.
    Prove that the mapping 
    $a \mapsto a^n$
    is an automorphism of $G$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
    Define \(\alpha : G\to G\) such that \(a\mapsto a^n\). Let \(g,h\in G\).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Injective:} Suppose \(g^n=h^n\).
        \begin{align*}
            g^n=h^n &\implies e=g^nh^{-n}\\
            &\implies e=(gh^{-1})^n\\
            &\implies |gh^{-1}|\mid n
        \end{align*}
        Additionally, \(gh^{-1}\in G\). By \emph{Lagrange's Theorem}, we have \(|gh^{-1}|\mid |G|\).
        Since \(|gh^{-1}|\) divides both \(n\) and \(|G|\), and \(gcd(n, |G|)=1\), we have that \(|gh^{-1}|=1\).
        Therefore, \(gh^{-1}=e\implies g=eh\implies g=h\).

        \item \textbf{Surjective:} Consider \(g^n\). We have that \(g\mapsto g^n\).
        \item \textbf{Preserves Group Operation:} \(\alpha(gh)=(gh)^n=g^nh^n=\alpha(g)\cdot \alpha(h)\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem} 
    Let $G$ be a group of order $pqr$, where $p$, $q$, $r$ are distinct primes. If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ of order $pq$ and $K$ is a subgroup of $G$ of order $qr$, prove that $|H \cap K| = q$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
    We have already proven that \(H\cap K\) is a subgroup of \(G\). This implies that \(H\cap K\) is also a
    subgroup of \(H\) and \(K\). By \emph{Lagrange's Theorem}, we have that 
    \[|H\cap K|\mid |H|,|K|\implies |H\cap K|\mid pq,qr\]
    Therefore, \(|H\cap K|\) is either \(1\) or \(q\). Assume for contradiction that
    \(|H\cap K|=1\). By lemma \ref{lem:HK}, we have that
    \[|HK|=\frac{pq\cdot qr}{1}=pq^2r\]
    which is a contradiction since \(HK\) is a subset of \(G\), which implies that
    \(|HK|\leq|G|\). Therefore, we have shown that \(|H\cap K|=q\) as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:HK}
    Let \(H\) and \(K\) be subgroups of a finite group \(G\). Then,
    \[|HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|} \text{ where } HK=\{hk\ |\ h\in H,\ k\in K\}\]
    
    \begin{proof}
        We can separate \(HK\) into a union of left cosets of \(K\) in \(G\):
        \[HK=\bigcup_{h\in H} hK\]
        By the properties of cosets, we have that \(hK=h'K\) or \(hK\cap h'K=\emptyset\) for all
        \(h,h'\in H\). We must now determine how many of these cosets are distinct.
        
        Suppose \(hK=h'K\) for some \(h,h'\in H\). Since \(hK=h'K \Leftrightarrow h^{-1}h'\in K\), we have that
        \(h^{-1}h'=k\) for some \(k\in K\). This implies that \(k\in H\implies k\in H\cap K\).
        Additionally, \(h'=hk\). Thus, there are \(|H\cap K|\) ways to create the same coset for each \(h'\in H\)
        (by \emph{Cayley's Theorem}, we know that each \(k\in H\cap K\) has exactly one corresponding \(h\in H\) such that
        \(hk=h'\)). Therefore, the number of distinct cosets \(hK\) where \(h\in H\) is \(|H|/|H\cap K|\).

        Since \(|hK|=|h'K|\) for all \(h,h'\in H\), the number of elements in each coset is \(|hK|=|K|\). Therefore,
        the cardinality of \(HK\) equals the number of distinct cosets times the number of distinct elements in each coset, giving us
        \[|HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}\]
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}
