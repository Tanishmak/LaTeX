%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem} 
    Consider $U(40)$. Find a subgroup which is cyclic of order 4. Find a subgroup which is noncyclic of order 4. 
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
    \(U(40)\) is defined as follows:
    \begin{align*}
        U(40) = \{1,3,7,9,11,13,17,19,21,23,27,29,31,33,37,39\}
    \end{align*}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Cyclic subgroup:} We will create a cyclic subgroup of order \(4\) using \(7\) as the generator.
        \begin{align*}
            \langle 7\rangle &= \{7,9,23,1\} & \text{(Gallian, 3.4)}
        \end{align*}
        \item \textbf{Non-cyclic subgroup:} We will show that \(\{1,9,11,19\}\) is a noncyclic subgroup.

        Cayley Table:
        \begin{tabular}{c | c c c c}
            & 1 & 9 & 11 & 19\\
            \cline{1-5}
            1 & 1 & 9 & 11 & 19 \\
            9 & 9 & 1 & 19 & 11 \\
            11 & 11 & 19 & 1 & 9 \\
            19 & 19 & 11 & 9 & 1
        \end{tabular}
    
        Since \(\{1,9,11,19\}\) is finite and closed under multiplication mod \(40\), we have proven
        that it is subgroup of \(U(40)\). Additionally, since \(|9|=|11|=|19|=2\), there is no element
        in this group which can generate the entire group, proving that it is noncyclic.
    
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}
    If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$, prove that $H \cap K$ is a subgroup of $G$. If $H \not \subset K$ and $K \not \subset H$, prove that $H \cup K$ is never a subgroup of $G$.
\end{problem}

\bigskip
1. \(H\cap K\) is a subgroup of \(G\).

\begin{proof}
    We will use the two-step subgroup test.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Closed over inverses:} \(x\in H\cap K \implies x\in H\) and
        \(x\in K\). Since \(H\) and \(K\) are subgroups, we have the existence of \(x^{-1}\in H\) and 
        \(x^{-1}\in K \implies x^{-1}\in H\cap K\). 

        \item \textbf{Closed under group operation:} \(a,b\in H\cap K\implies a,b\in H\) and \(a,b\in K\).
        Since \(H\) and \(K\) are subgroups, we have that \(ab\in H\) and \(ab\in K\implies ab\in H\cap K\).
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

2. If $H \not \subset K$ and $K \not \subset H$, $H \cup K$ is never a subgroup of $G$.
\begin{proof}
    
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem} 
    Prove that a group $G$ is Abelian if and only if $G = Z(G)$.
\end{problem}

\newpage

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem} 
    Suppose $G$ is a group with exactly 8 elements of order $3$. how many subgroups of order $3$ does $G$ have?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(H\subset G\) be a subgroup of order 3:
    \begin{align*}
        H = \{e, a, b\}
    \end{align*}
    Since \(e\) is unique, we have that \(ab\neq a\) and \(ab\neq b\). In order for \(H\) to be closed, 
    the only remaining choice is \(ab = e\). Thus, for any subgroup of order \(3\), the two elements besides
    the identity must be each other's inverse.

    Now, we will show that \(|a|=|b|=3\). Consider \(a^2\in H\). Since the identity is unique, \(a^2\neq a\),
    and since \(b\) is the unique inverse of \(a\), the only remaining choice is \(a^2=b\). Therefore,
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}[c]
            a^3 &= a \cdot a^2 \\
            &= a \cdot b\\
            &= e
        \end{aligned}
        \qquad\qquad
        \begin{aligned}[c]
            b^3 &= (a^2)^3\\
            &= (a^3)^2\\
            &= e
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
    We have that there are exactly \(8\) elements of \(G\) of order \(3\). Because a subgroup of order \(3\) 
    requires two distinct elements of order \(3\), we can conclude that the number of distinct subgroups of 
    order \(3\) in \(G\) is \(8 / 2 = 4\).
\end{proof}

    Let $G$ be a finite group with more than one element. Show that $G$ has an element of prime order.
